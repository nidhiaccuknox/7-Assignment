//using hooks is very simpler than using connect function

//useSelector Hooks: react redux library provide which acts as closed equivalent to the map state to 
//props function we have already seen so to get hold of any state that is maintained in the redux store we use
//useSelector hook.

//useDispatch: useDispatch hooks return reference to dispatch function from redux store
